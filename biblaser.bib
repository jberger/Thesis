  abstract={Using a model for the quasi-three-level laser dealing with Gaussian waves, taking into account the saturation of the pump, the stimulated emission at the pump wavelength, the variation of the pump and laser waists along propagation (important for laser diode pumping) and the variation of the laser intensity along propagation, we evaluate the more promising Yb 3+ -doped crystals for laser applications: YAG, LNB, GdCOB, YCOB, YAB, C-FAP, S-FAP, CLYPA, KGdW, KYW, Sc 2 O 3 , Y 2 O 3 , Lu 2 O 3 . Our evaluation, established for the CW oscillator regime, differs from that of Deloach and coworkers valid for ns pulse extraction mode. KYW, KGdW and Sc 2 O 3 are found to be the most efficient when considering the laser extracted power and S-FAP, C-FAP, YAG, KYW and KGdW are the most efficient when considering the small-signal gain of the amplifier regime.}

abstract = {We demonstrate what is to our knowledge the first mode-locked Yb:KGd(WO4)2 laser. Using a semiconductor saturable-absorber mirror for passive mode locking, we obtain pulses of 176-fs duration with an average power of 1.1 W and a peak power of 64 kW at a center wavelength of 1037 nm. We achieve pulses as short as 112 fs at a lower output power. The laser is based on a standard delta cavity and pumped by two high-brightness laser diodes, making the whole system very simple and compact. Tuning the laser by means of a knife-edge results in mode-locked pulses within a wavelength range from 1032 to 1054 nm. In cw operation, we achieve output powers as high as 1.3 W.},

The laser was pumped by a 25W fiber-coupled diode laser module operating at 980 nm wavelength. In the mode-locked regime, 296 fs duration pulses centered around 1031 nm were generated at a repetition rate of 61 MHz with a total average output power of up to 3.7W, corresponding to 205 kW of peak power and 60 nJ of energy per pulse. Compensation of positive intracavity dispersion was realized using a single chirped dielectric mirror.},

abstract = {Mode-locked operation of a simple Yb:KGW (potassium gadolinium tungstate) oscillator is described, providing 10W at 1039nm with a 290fs pulse width. A polarization-coupled scheme is used for efficient longitudinal pumping by a pair of reshaped laser diode bars. With changes in cavity dispersion, the pulse width is adjustable from 134 to 433fs, in a high-quality circular mode. A saturable absorber mirror provides self-starting operation, and the cavity is stabilized by the Kerr-lens effect.},
