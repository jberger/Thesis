  abstract={Using a model for the quasi-three-level laser dealing with Gaussian waves, taking into account the saturation of the pump, the stimulated emission at the pump wavelength, the variation of the pump and laser waists along propagation (important for laser diode pumping) and the variation of the laser intensity along propagation, we evaluate the more promising Yb 3+ -doped crystals for laser applications: YAG, LNB, GdCOB, YCOB, YAB, C-FAP, S-FAP, CLYPA, KGdW, KYW, Sc 2 O 3 , Y 2 O 3 , Lu 2 O 3 . Our evaluation, established for the CW oscillator regime, differs from that of Deloach and coworkers valid for ns pulse extraction mode. KYW, KGdW and Sc 2 O 3 are found to be the most efficient when considering the laser extracted power and S-FAP, C-FAP, YAG, KYW and KGdW are the most efficient when considering the small-signal gain of the amplifier regime.}

We achieve pulses as short as 112 fs at a lower output power. The laser is based on a standard delta cavity and pumped by two high-brightness laser diodes, making the whole system very simple and compact. Tuning the laser by means of a knife-edge results in mode-locked pulses within a wavelength range from 1032 to 1054 nm. In cw operation, we achieve output powers as high as 1.3 W.},

The results show that, in comparison with b-grown crystal, the N g -grown Nd:KGW is very promising for use at high repetition flash-lamp pumping rates. With the same laser cavity configuration, the N g -grown Nd:KGW can operate at an average flash-lamp input power of at least 1.4 kW, while the b-cut one ceases lasing at average flash-lamp input power of â¼0.5 kW. The reason for this is that the thermal lens induced in the N g -oriented Nd:KGW rod under pump radiation is relatively weak, nearly spherical and positive, whereas the b-grown Nd:KGW rod acts as a quite weak positive lens for radiation with radial polarization, and as a much stronger negative lens for tangentially polarized radiation.},

abstract = {The all solid-state combination of a saturable Bragg mirror for amplitude modulation and a cascaded $\chi$(2):$\chi$(2) nonlinearity (phase-mismatched second harmonic crystal) as an axial-mode phase locker for continuous-wave mode locking of large mode area lasers is investigated.  The dual-passive mode-locking technique generates extremely stable sub-10ps sech2 pulses at 76MHz from a ~6W, TEM00-mode, diode-pumped, thermal-lens-shaped, Brewster Nd:GdVO4 laser.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical model that describes the focusing conditions for second-harmonic generation (SHG) of focused femtosecond pulses as a function of group-velocity mismatch (GVM), with direct application to efficient SHG using a ``thick'' nonlinear crystal. We observe a direct dependence of the optimal focusing ratio, L/b, on the strength of group-velocity mismatch. Our model also describes the temporal duration of the second-harmonic pulses under these conditions as well as the change in optimal phase mismatch. The theoretical results are compared with an experiment for SHG with focused femtosecond pulses in a ``thick'' crystal of KNbO3.},
