The development of laboratory-scale instrumentation for the direct visualization of fundamental ultrafast (i.e., sub-nanosecond) events with nano-scale (even atomic) spatial resolution is a current active area of research~\cite{king_ultrafast_2005}.
In many areas of physics, chemistry and materials science a space-time resolution in the sub-1nm$\cdot$ps range is ideally required to allow for the observation of the fastest structural events.
A promising approach is to employ ultrashort pulses of electrons generated by a laser-driven 10-100keV photoelectron gun to probe the dynamics of the specimen that has been perturbed by a synchronized laser pulse~\cite{king_ultrafast_2005}.
Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) or femtosecond electron diffraction (FED)~\cite{srinivasan_ultrafast_2003,williamson_clocking_1997,cao_femtosecond_2003} is an example of this type of technique and has been used successfully to elucidate atomic-scale dynamics in melting~\cite{cao_femtosecond_2003,sciaini_electronic_2009,siwick_atomic-level_2003}, chemical bond breaking~\cite{zewail_laser_1988}, etc.
Direct time-resolved imaging of similar events can be accomplished using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
To date, such dynamic transmission electron microscopes (DTEMs)~\cite{bostanjoglo_tracing_1980,domer_high-speed_2003} have been developed for both single-shot imaging with $\sim$$10^{5}$nm$\cdot$ps space-time resolution (e.g., 30ns electron pulses and 5-10nm spatial resolution~\cite{lagrange_single-shot_2006,armstrong_practical_2007}) and $\sim$1nm$\cdot$ps space-time resolution ($\sim$100fs with a few nanometer resolution~\cite{park_direct_2009}) in the multi-shot data acquisition mode of operation.
Both of these instruments employ retro-fitted standard electron microscope columns and are limited in performance mainly by space-charge effects.

Improvements in the performance of DTEMs, especially ultrafast electron microscopes (UEMs), and UED systems will likely require the implementation of techniques that offset or compensate for deleterious space-charge effects~\cite{armstrong_prospects_2007,lobastov_four-dimensional_2005}.
Such performance optimization efforts will require efficient models of electron pulse propagation dynamics that include the ability to simulate the action of electron optical elements (including the photoelectron gun itself) on the pulse.
Indeed $2^{\text{nd}}$ generation UED instruments are now beginning to employ both magnetic lenses and RF cavities~\cite{oudheusden_electron_2007,veisz_hybrid_2007} to optimize the electron pulse delivery to the specimen; that is, compensate for global space-charge effects in both the transverse and longitudinal pulse dimensions, respectively.
Similarly, future UEM column designs are expected to use RF pulse compression cavities while circumventing high charge density beam cross-overs (i.e., beam foci).

In Chapter \ref{chap:ms_model}, I will introduce the of the work of Michalik and Sipe~\cite{michalik_analytic_2006,michalik_erratum:_2008}, describing free-space electron bunch propagation in an mean-field self-similar Analytic Gaussian (AG) pulse treatment.
For free-space propagation, the AG model of charge bunch dynamics has already been shown to be very consistent with full Monte Carlo (i.e., particle tracking) simulations for a wide variety of electron pulse shapes~\cite{michalik_analytic_2006,michalik_evolution_2009}, including the uniform ellipsoid~\cite{luiten_how_2004}.
Due primarily to the versatility of the AG model which results from its use of transverse and longitudinal pulse position and momentum variances, the AG approach is applicable to both the single electron per pulse limit~\cite{lobastov_four-dimensional_2005}, where momentum variances determine the pulse evolution and the model is exact (obeying Gaussian optics), and the high charge density limit in which space-charge effects dominate~\cite{luiten_how_2004,siwick_ultrafast_2002,cao_femtosecond_2003}.
Unfortunately, the model lacks the ability to model the dynamics of electron pulses under influence of external forces; this prevents the AG model from being used to simulate the behavior of electron pulses in realistic microscope columns.
Additionally, to be useful for UEM, for which initial pulse conditions are of notable importance for the performance of the instrument, a realistic set of intial conditions is essential for accurately modeling the pulse dynamics.

In Chapter \ref{chap:extension}, I present some optimizations to the AG model, and develop useful initial conditions representing single-photon photoemission from a typical metal photocathode.
I then present my extensions to the Michalik and Sipe AG model which permit the inclusion of generic linear external forces, such as those due to perfect electron-optical elements in a microscope column.
In order to adapt this extended AG model for simulating pulses in a realistic UEM column, I then present specific contributions that arise from magnetic lenses, RF cavities and DC accelerators.
The resulting computationally efficient propagation analysis can then be used to model, and hence design, UEM columns and UED systems in a straightforward manner.
Note that the analyses presented are performed in the non-relativistic limit, which is a reasonable approximation for the typical 20-200keV electron energies employed in UED and electron microscopy.

In Chapter \ref{chap:model_results}, I apply the extended AG model to draw some initial insight into the dynamics of ultrafast electron pulses traversing a UEM column.
One of the conclusions that I will make is that oblate, or ``disk-like'', electron pulses will be generally preferred to prolate ``cigar-like;'' for UEM, the electron pulses are likely to be oblate for reasonably sized incident laser spot sizes.
Then in Chapter \ref{chap:considerations}, I apply some well known results from the field of electron microcopy, namely the Rose criterion~\cite{rose_television_1948}, an ultrafast analog to the Child-Langmuir law~\cite{child_discharge_1911,langmuir_effect_1923,valfells_effects_2002}, and the conservation of transverse emittance~\cite{jensen_emittance_2010} (each of which will be introduced) to arrive at two design goals for building a UEM which will produce high-resolution images.
First, that the electron pulses should be emitted from a large-area source, and second, that every effort must be made to reduce the initial rms transverse momentum (i.e., the emission cone angle).

All of these considerations motivate the construction of the prototype UEM column being built by our group at UIC.
In Chapter \ref{chap:prototype}, I detail the design and fabrication of large-aperture electron-optical elements, which can readily admit these large width electron pulses; included among these are the accelerator and magnetic lenses.
Then, before I conclude, I will in Chapter \ref{chap:photocathode} highlight the photocathode engineering work which has been undertaken in an attempt to reduce the rms transverse momentum of the emitted electron pulses.
In fact, the search for a low transverse momentum electron source has applications beyond UEM and UED; the fields of X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs,~\cite{nemeth_high_2010}) and Compact X-ray Light Sources (CXLS) \cite{cxls_workshop_report_2012} will also benefit from such a source.
I will present investigations of several different photoemission processes, some of which are yielding very promising results.
In fact, our recent work on excited-state thermionic emission~\cite{berger_excited_2012} may even challenge long-standing ideas about which materials and processes may hold the keys to low-emittance (or high-brightness) electron sources.
