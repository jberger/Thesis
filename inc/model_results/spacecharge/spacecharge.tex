\subsection{Effect of Space Charge} \label{sec:free_spacecharge}

A full analysis of how high the charge density may be before deleterious space-charge become unmanagable would be a sizable task.
Much discussion could be had on the degree of distortion allowable as well as considerations of the initial shape of the pulse and length and arrangement of the column and its constituent elements.

Purely for illustrative purposes I am including \ref{fig:spacecharge} to provide an intuition about the order of magnitude of these effects.

    The final HW1/eM width (solid) and length (dashed) of similar initial size pulses for different number of electrons in the pulse.
    The pulse is generated by 1 mm (HW1/eM) width 1 ps laser pulses with 0.5eV excess photoemission energy. The pulse then traverses a 20mm acceleration region and a 15cm drift region.
