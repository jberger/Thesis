	abstract = {Chemical bonding dynamics are fundamental to the understanding of properties and behavior of materials and molecules. Here, we demonstrate the potential of time-resolved, femtosecond electron energy loss spectroscopy {(EELS)} for mapping electronic structural changes in the course of nuclear motions. For graphite, it is found that changes of milli-electron volts in the energy range of up to 50 electron volts reveal the compression and expansion of layers on the subpicometer scale (for surface and bulk atoms). These nonequilibrium structural features are correlated with the direction of change from sp2 [two-dimensional {(2D)} graphene] to sp3 {(3D-diamond)} electronic hybridization, and the results are compared with theoretical charge-density calculations. The reported femtosecond time resolution of four-dimensional {(4D)} electron microscopy represents an advance of 10 orders of magnitude over that of conventional {EELS} methods.

The iron nanofilm specimen is heated at a maximum rate of $\sim$1011 K/s by a single heating pulse, and the evolution of the phase transformation from body-centered cubic to face-centered cubic crystal structure is followed by means of single-pulse, selected-area diffraction and real-space imaging. Two distinct components are revealed in the evolution of the crystal structure. The first, on the nanosecond time scale, is a direct martensitic transformation, which proceeds in regions heated into the temperature range of stability of the fcc phase, 1185-1667 K. The second, on the microsecond time scale, represents an indirect process for the hottest central zone of laser heating, where the temperature is initially above 1667 K and cooling is the rate-determining step. The mechanism of the direct transformation involves two steps, that of (barrier-crossing) nucleation on the reported nanosecond time scale, followed by a rapid grain growth typically in $\sim$100 ps for 10 nm crystallites.},

	abstract = { Although recent years have seen significant advances in the spatial resolution possible in the transmission electron microscope {(TEM),} the temporal resolution of most microscopes is limited to video rate at best. This lack of temporal resolution means that our understanding of dynamic processes in materials is extremely limited. High temporal resolution in the {TEM} can be achieved, however, by replacing the normal thermionic or field emission source with a photoemission source. In this case the temporal resolution is limited only by the ability to create a short pulse of photoexcited electrons in the source, and this can be as short as a few femtoseconds. The operation of the photo-emission source and the control of the subsequent pulse of electrons (containing as many as $5\cdot10^{7}$ electrons) create significant challenges for a standard microscope column that is designed to operate with a single electron in the column at any one time. In this paper, the generation and control of electron pulses in the {TEM} to obtain a temporal resolution {\textbackslash}textless10-6 s will be described and the effect of the pulse duration and current density on the spatial resolution of the instrument will be examined. The potential of these levels of temporal and spatial resolution for the study of dynamic materials processes will also be discussed.},

As such, {2D} and {3D} microscopies provide static structures with subnanometer and increasingly with angstrom-scale spatial resolution. Here we report the development of {4D} ultrafast electron microscopy, whose capability imparts another dimension to imaging in general and to dynamics in particular. We demonstrate its versatility by recording images and diffraction patterns of crystalline and amorphous materials and images of biological cells. The electron packets, which were generated with femtosecond laser pulses, have a de Broglie wavelength of 0.0335 angstrom at 120 {keV} and have as low as one electron per pulse. With such few particles, doses of few electrons per square angstrom, and ultrafast temporal duration, the long sought after but hitherto unrealized quest for ultrafast electron microscopy has been realized. Ultrafast electron microscopy should have an impact on all areas of microscopy, including biological imaging.

To reduce space charge {(SC)} broadening the number of electrons in the bunch is reduced and the gun is operated at a megahertz {(MHz)} repetition rate for providing a high average number of electrons at the target. Simulations of the electron gun were carried out under the condition of no {SC} and with {SC} assuming various numbers of electrons in the bunch. Transversal effects such as defocusing after the dc extraction hole were also taken into account. A detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the pulse duration to various parameters was performed to test the realizability of the concept.

For the particles studied, the subsequent recovery occurs in about 1 ns. Because of the selectivity of excitation from the 3d-band, and the relatively low fluence used, these results show the critical role of carriers in weakening the {V4+V4+} bonding in the monoclinic phase and the origin of the nonequilibrium phase.

Most biological processes, chemical reactions and materials dynamics occur at rates much faster than can be captured with standard video rate acquisition methods in transmission electron microscopes {(TEM).} Thus, there is a need to increase the temporal resolution in order to capture and understand salient features of these rapid materials processes. This paper details the development of a high-time resolution dynamic transmission electron microscope {(DTEM)} that captures dynamics in materials with nanosecond time resolution. The current {DTEM} performance, having a spatial resolution {\textless}10 nm for single-shot imaging using 15 ns electron pulses, will be discussed in the context of experimental investigations in solid state reactions of {NiAl} reactive multilayer films, the study of martensitic transformations in nanocrystalline Ti and the catalytic growth of Si nanowires.

	volume = {302},
	doi = {10.1126/science.1090052},
	abstract = {We used 600-femtosecond electron pulses to study the structural evolution of aluminum as it underwent an ultrafast laser-induced solid-liquid phase transition. Real-time observations showed the loss of long-range order that was present in the crystalline phase and the emergence of the liquid structure where only short-range atomic correlations were present; this transition occurred in 3.5picoseconds for thin-film aluminum with an excitation fluence of 70 millijoules per square centimeter. The sensitivity and time resolution were sufficient to capture the time-dependent pair correlation function as the system evolved from the solid to the liquid state. These observations provide an atomic-level description of the melting process, in which the dynamics are best understood as a thermal phase transition under strongly driven conditions.

    This chapter provides a contrast of almost endless variety and complexity of picture pickup devices with the simplicity and universality of the performance scale according to which any of these devices may be judged. It underlines the highly not very unique character of any one pickup tubeâ€”and there are scores of them. It was introduced as a selfevident argument for singling out only a few pickup tubes for close attention and these for the one purpose of tracing the successive realized approximations to ideal pickup tube performance. A complete general relation is derived for the amount of information that a picture pickup device can furnish as a function of the brightness of scene at which it is directed. Because the final limitations of pickup devices are set by the quantum nature of light, because these limitations have not been widely discussed, and because the particular devices in the new developing field of television are of less interest for the mechanics of their operations, the emphasis throughout has been on the setting up of an absolute scale of performance according to which the many and diverse pickup devices can be oriented."

For intensities below âˆ¼1 GW/cm2, four-photon photoelectric emission is observed. For higher intensities three-photon assisted thermionic emission dominates. A generalized Fowler-DuBridge theory accounts quantitatively for our observations. A polycrystal surface cleaned by picosecond laser pulses has a work function different from surfaces cleaned by ordinary heating methods."
